Description: Implements Wavelet-based Quantile Transfer Entropy analysis for 
    financial time series following the methodology of Baruník and Křehlík (2018) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.01.012>. Provides tools for analyzing market 
    interconnectedness, financial contagion, and risk spillover effects across 
    different time scales and market conditions using Maximum Overlap Discrete 
    Wavelet Transform (MODWT) as described in Percival and Walden (2000, ISBN:0521685087).
    Features include wavelet decomposition, quantile transfer entropy calculation 
    based on Koenker and Bassett (1978) <doi:10.2307/1913643>, network analysis, 
    and visualization tools for financial market analysis.
