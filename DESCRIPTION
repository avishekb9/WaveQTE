Description: Implements Wavelet-based Quantile Transfer Entropy analysis for 
    financial time series. Provides tools for analyzing market interconnectedness,
    financial contagion, and risk spillover effects across different time scales
    and market conditions. Features include wavelet decomposition, quantile transfer
    entropy calculation, network analysis, and visualization tools for financial
    market analysis.
